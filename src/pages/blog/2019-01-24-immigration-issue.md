  Hey guys, so I received a few responses from some of you on Twitter about
  topic suggestions. Someone suggested I chime my opinion in about this
  particular issue. To be honest, I was a little hesitant to do so. I really
  dislike how political views are distorted through twitter and college
  campuses. So as a disclaimer, just because someone has opinions different then
  yours, does that make them racist or ignorant.

As an Hispanic, with Hispanic family members who recently immigrated to this country, I understand the humanitarian side of the immigration issue 100 percent. As a realist, I also understand that this country cannot simply open its borders and let anyone come in whenever they please with no paperwork process. I wish we could! I really really wish it can be that simple, créeme, familia.

I’m not going to bore you guys to death with politics. Honestly, the chances are the small percentage of you actually reading this don’t want to read a full length essay about immigration. I also know it’s easy to see things on Twitter and get very emotionally provoked by them. At the end of the day, illegal immigration is a socio-economic problem that many are even dying behind. Current immigration proceedings are bullshit and need to make it easier for people who want to come to this amazing country and start a new better life. Anyways, what the fuck do I know? I’m just some guy in a basement ha ha.
