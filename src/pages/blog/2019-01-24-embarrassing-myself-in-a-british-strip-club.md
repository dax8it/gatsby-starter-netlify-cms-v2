title: Embarrassing Myself in a British Strip Club

  I was honestly hoping that this wouldn’t be the topic that won the vote haha.
  It involves me at 18 years old, really having my first taste of adult club
  life. I can’t remember how this idea was originally brought up, but I was able
  to accompany my dad on a business trip to London.

Being an 18 year old shit head, of course my first thought was the realization that the drinking age in most European counties is 18 years old. My adolescent imagination immediately conjured up fantasies of crazy night life and naked women covered in expensive champagne. Totally forgetting my lack of money and social skills, I wandered around the first night to “live the dream”. Our hotel was right by the Piccadilly Circus area on the western end of the city. I wandered around the city drunk on jägerbombs that I had charged to my father’s company card. While I stumbled around the city streets in search of this profound adult experience I envisioned myself having, I ended up in front of one of London’s finest gentleman clubs.

I staggered on over to the bouncer with the linebacker build. Wafting my Justin Bieber like hair to the side and putting on the sloppiest shit-eating grin, I looked the gentleman in his less than welcoming eyes and stated that I would like to gain entrance into his fine and respectable establishment. Our friend looked me up and down and sternly told me that I didn’t meet the dress code and to get lost. This added to the confusion of my already confused state, because I was wearing all my dads business clothes with a $200 pair of Nike Air Maxes. He pointed to my obnoxiously flashy shoes and told me that they were what was preventing me from going inside. Shocked, I countered this statement by educating our friend on how much they costed and before I got to tell him that they worth more than his life, he quickly told me to fuck myself and sent me on my way.

After getting lost a few times and countlessly rehearsing the clever comebacks I could have said to the bouncer, I finally made it back to the nice hotel that my dad’s company had put us up in. “Dad I need to borrow your shoes tomorrow night so I can get into this strip club tomorrow night.” At this point in life, both my parents were pretty exhausted from my nonsense. He gave me the shoes and told me to be careful and don’t do anything stupider than usual and off I went.

After charging a few more rounds of liquor infused energy drinks to my father’s company card, I headed off into the night to grab adulthood by the horns. After brushing through the dreads of society, being offered everything from ecstasy to Asian school girls, I finally made it to the club. (I was actually pick pocketed on the way by people pretending to be drunk but that’s another story) I confidently planted myself in front of the same bouncer and make a joke about how I changed my shoes, which he did not even remotely smile at.

I was finally on the doorstep of my adult life (so I believed). I suddenly didn’t feel very well, and this was amplified by my caffeine and alcohol mixture. I was approached by a fully naked and platinum blonde German stripper and suddenly felt like a little boy again. After I picked my jaw up off of the floor and was able to tune back into reality, I found myself being informed that I was a little short on money for a private dance but that she’d make an exception because I was American. We went into the private room and I was suddenly hit with an overwhelming urge to pee. Too awestruck and nervous to say anything, I decided to just stick this one out for the experience. She sat me down and I didn’t know what to do with my hands so I placed them under my thighs and sat on them for the entirety of this experience.

While the German stripper was grinding in my lap, I couldn’t think of anything else but the fact that I had to pee so bad and how awkward this was because I was being absolutely silent and slightly bouncing my leg. She was trying to make small talk to me and asked me what my father did for a living and why I was in town. After explaining how he was in investment banking and we were here on business, I had to awkwardly smile at her suggestion to bring him along next time. This cringeworthy dance was finally coming to an end and all of a sudden this burst of liquid courage flowed through me and I decided to flirt with the dancer. She had asked me if I could buy her a drink. I used the charisma that I believed I possessed and instead asked her to purchase me one. She smiled and said it would be by the bar. After finally making it to the bathroom, I ventured over to the bar where I found some water in a plastic cup. I sipped the water like a moron until security came up to me and told me I had to leave if I couldn’t afford the drink minimum. I walked back to my hotel pondering how my cringe worthy 20 minute first taste of adult hood played out. Since this experience, I haven’t found attending another strip club to be on my list of priorities. I am however grateful that I have another story of absurdity to keep around and tell through out the years.
