  Ask anyone about veganism, and chances are they’ll have a strong opinion one
  way or the other. Love it or hate it, people tend to associate a vegan diet
  with being thin, losing weight and better health. I sat down with someone who
  is a walking contradiction to the average person’s idea of what someone on a
  plant-based diet looks like. Meet Connor the Scottish vegan body builder.

**Let’s start off by addressing your choice to become vegan and what lead you to do so**



“I became vegan at the beginning of 2017, I weight trained for one year before that, I then badly dislocated my left shoulder which required surgery. During this time I did some research on plant-based diets and their benefits not only to the planet, but also to your health. I’ve always said I’m an animal lover, too, and while doing my research the horrible truth of factory farming  came to light and also the realization that you can’t call yourself an animal lover and pay someone to put a knife across their throats at the same time. I had stopped consuming eggs and dairy products six months before, so taking the next step to eliminate animal flesh was an easy decision.

After the rehabilitation period of my shoulder, I had been vegan for one year, and I was feeling great, I had more energy, my skin cleared up, I was sleeping better and I hadn’t got sick like I used to. Being on a plant-based diet had definitely helped with the healing and recovery of my shoulder because I had incredibly fast progress, so the surgeon and physiotherapist told me. That was 14 months ago and I’ve been in the gym five days a week since and put on some serious lean muscle mass – about 15kg while staying under 12-13% body fat.”

**You hear countless stories about miraculous recovery after implementing a vegan diet, from all ranges of health complications. When it comes to building muscle, what do you believe the biggest misconceptions are when it comes to putting muscle mass on while being plant-based?**

“The biggest misconception about plant-based training is that it’s difficult to get sufficient protein. And I often still get asked ‘where do you get your protein‘ and my answer is ‘where you get yours from‘ – plants! Mine is just not recycled through dead animals. I get it from the source. I easily consume 160-200g of protein per day which is sufficient being 88kg.”

**What do you believe it will take for vegan body building to hit more of a mainstream audience?**

Vegan body building is already being more and more mainstream when people see and have the result themselves. Some famous successful vegans I’ve listed below:

Formula 1 legend Lewis Hamilton has four championships to his name. 
- Patrik Baboumian Germany’s strongest man.
- Carl Lewis voted world athlete of the decade (1980) winner of nine Olympic gold medals.
- Kendrick Farris is Team USA’s only male weightlifter to qualify for the Rio Olympics.

And the list goes on...

**What differences have you noticed in your training while on a plant-based diet?**

“When I used to train before a plant-based diet and I went in for a big gym session, I would be wrecked for the rest of the day. Now after a big session in the gym I can still go hiking and take my dog for a run and I don’t lose energy. By default I now intake so much more antioxidants and anti- inflammatory foods which help with this loads.“

**That’s pretty fascinating, Connor. What advice would you have for someone looking to get into this lifestyle?**

“Advice for people wanting to make the transition to a plant-based diet. Do it at your own pace, it doesn’t have to be overnight. Find what foods you love and veganize it. Do your research. And make sure you are eating sufficient calories for your body. “

**I’m currently in the process of transitioning into a vegetarian diet and I find that taking it slower tends to keep me from being discouraged and allows me to really adjust. Appreciate your time, man. Hope all the readers learned something or gained a new perspective. Thank you again, Connor.**
