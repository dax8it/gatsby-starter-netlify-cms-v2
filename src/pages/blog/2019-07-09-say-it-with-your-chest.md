As I continue my "digital nomad" journey into adulthood and professionalism, I learn more and more about things like money, power, and respect. As corny as it may sound, I say this unironically. Hate it or love it guys, we live in a society where money talks and bullshit walks. We live in a society where only the strong survive. We live in a society where people's words do not always match up with their actions. However, there is a positive perspective on all of this as well. This system allows for a few people who really put the work in, to truly succeed and live life as they please.

Fortunately for me, this system allowed a felon with barely two years of community college under his belt to make money and travel the world with his beautiful partner. To be honest, after some serious thought, I wholeheartedly feel that there are things about the adult justice system that prepares you for the adult corporate world. Believe it or not, the rec yard and the conference room do have a lot in common.

There is a common expression in jail that you can regularly hear aggressively thrown around the lunch line of any complex you (hopefully) don't end up in. "Say it with your chest lil boy!" As you can imagine, jail isn't really the place for introverts or social anxiety. However, I will say that a regular routine of reading books, strict exercise, and playing mental chess with predators and gangbangers definitely changes the way you go about your day to day interactions.

Now lets fast forward a bit, being 22 and running a company is not exactly a walk in the park either. The adult world is filled with shady clients, business owners, and landlords. Things like eye contact, saying no, and speaking confidently are crucial. For example, some people in jail will do what is called "friendly extortion." Picture noisy metal gates opening and about 50 men turning their heads to instantly write you off as cool or somebody who they can extort for everything from phone calls to commissary. Now picture finally unpacking your stuff and immediately being asked for a phone call or a pop tart from a complete stranger. This stranger will try and capitalize on any sign of weakness you show and will hide under the guise of friend, rather than foe. 

To save time, I won't go into all the ways how that can turn pretty problematic very quickly.

 Now picture being a young professional, and older "successful adults" are paying you late, asking for ridiculously priced discounts, or any other type of dishonest behavior simply because they think they can. I wrote this piece mainly for any other young people out there who are in business for themselves. These waters are shark infested my friends. Start reading in between the lines of those emails and invoices, really ask yourself if you are responsible for the damage your landlord is taking out of your deposit, and turn down that ridiculous rate you just got offered in exchange for "potential future opportunities."
