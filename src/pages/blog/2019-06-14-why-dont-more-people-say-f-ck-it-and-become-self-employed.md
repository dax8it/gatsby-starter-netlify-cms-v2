It is the dream of every single artist, business person, and business owner to become 100% self-reliable and self-employed. Have you ever noticed the self-discouraging attitude that some people pick up when asked why don’t they wholeheartedly pursue their passions and live the life they want to live?

\~little disclaimer\~

This entire post is simply just my opinion, and my thoughts on entrepreneurship at 3 am after working almost 24 hours straight. There is zero affiliate marketing; I’m not selling a course, I do not care about and do not care to learn anything having to do with E-Commerce. 

Ok with that off my chest, I believe there are a few reasons why such skewed attitudes on self-employment and location independence exist. 

# **Fear**

Fear...the most obvious reason. People are scared to fail. People view “failure” as doomsday, and just the fear of this socio-economic suicide prevents people from even trying to pursue something different. Sometimes in this game, you have to invest in yourself, and people get uncomfortable when it’s time to do that. You have to look at it like this when making decisions like that, “if I’m afraid to put money into my craft..why would someone else put even more money into it??”

# **Perception **

“Envy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth” Let me start by saying that I absolutely am aware of, and take a dim view towards the fact that some millennials born into wealth, are out there traveling the world, because they are able to sell the idea of wealth through drop shipping schemes and altered analytics reports. Bad apples like these discourage people from really diving into the waters of freelance and self-employment. 

# **The Truth **

When push comes to shove, nothing worth pursuing is easily attainable. This road is a hard road filled with unexpected challenges, frustration, and time consumption. If you take the time to master your craft, network, and bet on yourself sometimes. I honestly don’t feel it’s as tricky as some people make it out to be, but it requires self-discipline and _real old fashioned gritty hard work... _

Keep your head down, watch out for the snakes, work hard, love what you do, and believe in yourself and who knows how far you can go?
