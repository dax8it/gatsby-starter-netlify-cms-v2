title: How Working at HomeGoods Deepened My Contempt for Humanity

  There is just something so special about the joyous world of retail during the
  holiday season. You can really feel the cheer being spread amongst the long
  lines, screaming customers, and crying employees. In order to save money for
  this cross-country move that I am embarking on in a few weeks, I picked up a
  seasonal position at a HomeGoods in my area. It’s common knowledge that
  working in retail is pretty undesirable. Everyone knows someone, who knows
  someone else, who has horror stories to share about their retail working days.

I remember my first day on the job I was assigned to be trained by one of the front end cashiers. For story purposes, let’s refer to her as Kelly. Kelly seemed like a perfectly respectable middle aged woman. While training up front, I really noticed the disrespect and attitude that these employees encounter on a daily basis. There was one specific incident that day that was so painfully awkward and none of the hiring managers prepared me for.

As per usual, the line was extremely long and everyone was on edge. The customers somehow find a way to blame the employees for their inconvenience and routinely take this out on us every chance they get. This pregnant woman comes up to the register that me and Kelly are working at. Based off her facial expressions and body language, I could tell she was a ticking time bomb. She asked Kelly if she had to wait back in line if she wished to return her purchase and Kelly responded with, “yes ma’am, you’ll have to wait in line again with everyone else.” There is no tone through text, so you might have read that with a little attitude, but I promise you it was said perfectly calm and polite. Our pregnant antagonist was not pleased with this answer and quickly hurled a barrage of insults at Kelly.

She informed Kelly that she hates her job and should go find a new one where she won’t be so rude to customers. Keep in mind, I’m standing there awkwardly on my first day of working at this place. I’m not sure exactly where I should be looking, so I’m aiming my gaze to the floor while this verbal assault is happening a few inches away from me. I finally look up and see Kelly tearing up while the customer has no gotten the manager involved. The sheer awkwardness of the situation makes me want to laugh because I see her crying and have no idea what I am supposed to do. She noticed that I glanced over at her and says to me how sorry she is and how this never happens. Not truly convinced that this is such a rare occurrence, I stare back into the plastic bags I have to fill and fantasize about the day I no longer need to work soul draining jobs like this anymore. This is just one of the odd experiences I went through while working there and I really use them as motivation to do something with my life. Also just want to point out, 9 times out of 10 the manager thinks you’re an asshole too so just save your breath.
