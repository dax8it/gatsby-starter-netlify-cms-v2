  Alright well, you guys voted (thanks to everyone who did) and here it is. So
  when I was 19, my life was a nightmare. I hated myself and was mad at the
  world and acted out on this misery continuously. This led up to an arrest in
  Long Island for which I could not afford bail and ended up in Nassau County
  Jail for a period of 9 months.

I want to just say that I am in no way glorifying this, making jail seem cool, or trying to make myself seem tough, or anything of that nature. Jail fucking sucks, you have not seen this level of misery or human tragedy until you have seen the inside of a prison or jail.

To make matters even worse for myself, the crime that I was charged with was deemed a violent felony under New York State law, so I was classified as a maximum security inmate and only housed with inmates with this same classification. I entered my first maximum security pod at 19 years old, 6 feet tall, and weighing 155 pounds soaking wet.

A situation had come up where I was forced to defend myself and had gotten moved into another unit on the same floor of the west wing of the jail. This is where I met Rich the Skinhead. (Unbeknownst to me at the time)

Rich  looked very similar to the man in the picture above, except a little older and had even more tattoos. I heard him from across the unit before I ever met him. He was very loud and no one seemed to say anything because of his behemoth build. One day during lunch, he was screaming through his cell door, that if anyone did not want their tray to give it to him.

My body still wasn’t accustomed to consuming the sludge that passes for food in the correctional system, so I nonchalantly  slid my tray under his cell door.  This is where the first red flag that I failed to notice comes up, Rich’s eyes lit up and he said, “thanks man, you know we have to look out for each other in here.”

Richard hung out with two other guys named Scotty and Danny. Scotty was an older man with a handle bar mustache and Danny must have been around 25. They were all Irish and they all shaved their heads. None of them outwardly said anything racist or had visible tattoos related to white supremacy that I noticed, so I figured they were just old school white guys. So for about a week, to the confusion of all the inmates that had heard me speak Spanish before, I worked out with these guys and ate with them every day.

One day during chow, we were all eating together and Scotty looked up at me and said in his old school New York accent “Jordan, when are you shaving that mop off your head? It’s embarassing!” Mind you, my hair was a little bit longer than the average shape up at this point. I awkwardly laughed and explained how I wasn’t really into that look while maintaining eye contact with my food. “You know how these Italian grease balls are Scotty leave home alone” Danny said.

“What part of Italy is your family from anyway?” He asked. I hesitated because I suddenly realized who these people were and what they represented. “I’m actually C-c-Colombian” I said. Our whole table got silent and they all stared at me. Luckily the guard was rushing us back to our cells anyway so I was saved by the bell. Richard came to my cell after, but this time did not bring his usual friendly persona. He explained to me that I had embarrassed them but since I was new to jail and didn’t know any better they were going to give me a pass. I was to not speak to them, workout with them, or eat with them. He then collected all the books he had let me borrow and we never really spoke again. The whole thing seemed like an ugly breakup, and I didn’t know whether to laugh or be afraid. From that moment on, I stuck with my own people for the remaining period of my incarceration.
