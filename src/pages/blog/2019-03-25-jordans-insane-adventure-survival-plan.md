Hey guys, sorry I’m a little late on the blog, WiFi wasn’t working for some reason. I decided I’m going to format this piece sort of similar to “Neds Declassified School Survival Guide” but call it “Jordan’s Insane Adventure Survival Plan.” Essentially, showing what you need to do to be able to do something maybe you’re scared of doing. (Cause hey I did it, and things are looking pretty bright).

Tip #101: Stick to the Plan 



It’s okay, the plans can be a little risky. This project is supposed to make you a little nervous. Keep in mind that if you spend all your time planning and obsessing over every single aspect, you might never actually put anything into action. I would tell people the Oregon plan, and they would say things like “dude that’s fucking crazy, but I hope it works for you.” That’s fine, as long as there is some sort of method to the madness that’s a good sign.

This leads perfectly into the next tip...



 



Tip #202 Always have a Backup Plan:



This is the most crucial part. My life has been far from average, and there have been plenty of occurrences where things did not exactly go as plan. Basically, there are 3 types of people. One with a plan blinded by pride which is not willing to adapt, one with an idea but too scared to put it into action, and the third just don’t even know what the hell is going on. You separate yourself by having grand plans and ideas, but always having a backup plan in case things don’t work out you don’t waste any time and you can just adjust and improvise.  







Tip #303: “Scared Money Don’t Make No Money” 



While this expression is popularized in hip-hop music, the same mentality can be applied to different aspects of everyday life. The phrase can be translated to “you cannot prosper if you don’t take risks” or “you won’t be able to do the things you want to do if you don’t cut costs and take a little risk.” Most young people give up on moving out of their parent's house cause it’s expensive. Trust me from personal experience, it can be costly, but my girlfriend and I are doing it off of 25 hours a week and freelance work and are having the time of our lives. Consider renting with a cool roommate and think about things like walking some places to save gas and you’d be amazed by what you can do. 







Unfortunately, that’s all the time I got cause WiFi isn’t working and I got a bunch of proposals to work on, but honestly stay reading because I’m just documenting the experience and trying to spread some hope for free. A lot of people sell guides, coaching, and all that bullshit. Guys, I’m human. Human interaction and emotion is the only reason I share this with you guys :)
