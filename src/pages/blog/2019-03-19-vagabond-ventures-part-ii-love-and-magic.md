Okay gang, good news and bad news. The good news is that this post isn't going to be as sappy and dinky as it suggests. Bad news is that if youâ€™re the type of person who is absolutely disgusted by positivity, repulsed by joy, or angered easily when hearing good news about anyone other than yourself....then this might not be the post for you my friend.

So if that didn't scare you off, then I am glad to welcome you to my page and appreciate you taking the time to listen to what some 22 year old kid from New Jersey has to say. It has been a while since I have been able to write a blog post for fun, but on the plus side it's because I have been so absorbed in the beginning stages of my freelance career. In order to share all my experiences and perspective from this last month in a coherent organized fashion, we should start where we left off last month in Vagabond Ventures Part I: Pitbulls and Cocaine Addicted Hippies.



I was in a tough spot and the future was looking grim. However there was one thing I said at the end of the post that I really took to heart. "My hypothesis is that as long as you exercise integrity and kindness...everything will fall into place the way it should. I am happy to report that I have continued to put this hypothesis to the test in the experiment of life, and have yet to be mistaken.



Let's start with this record breaking snow storm that hit the Eugene area and put so many people out of work, and even out of of electricity. I was one of the hundreds of employees who clocked in at 6:15 am at one of the largest granola processing plants in the entire world. At 3:00 pm I clocked out, went home, and like many other employees I would come home and throw myself on the nearest piece of furniture and lay there in an attempt to recharge and refuel just to wake up at 5:30 am to go repeat the process all over again. The snow storm had already put me out of work for two days, and I was looking at a third as I slipped and slid around the empty icy highway in my 2010 convertible death trap. I was dreading going to work today for three reasons.

If I crashed this car, I was royally fucked

8 hours of idling in the monotony of the road isn't exactly what helps me get out of bed at 5:30 am

The hours that I had already lost set us a little short of rent for a new spot 

So, after a 30 minute commute I finally arrive at the plant, only to find a desolate employee parking lot. I get out of my car and am greeted by one of my supervisors who tells me that the plant is closed and to come back at noon. Mind you, my gaslight is on, and I have been eating ramen noodles the last three days so I can't even afford to go back home and then make the commute again. This is where the magic happens, ladies and gentleman.



I know that I can't go back to work, and I know that a job hunt for me can take some time. (felony marijuana charge after just turning 18) I am also terrified to go back home and tell my girlfriend that my job flew out the window once again. That is when it hit me: I came out here to go to college and be a writer and just because college isn't plausible right now, why can't I just put my heart and soul into what I love to do, and see what happens? I went home, looked my scared girlfriend in her beautiful green eyes, and said "Baby, I am not going back to any of these godforsaken jobs. We're figuring something else out." Hesitant, but trusting, she heard me out and supported me. (for which I am forever grateful, Blake Lower)

This is where our current roommate Ben comes into the picture. We met Ben on Craigslist, toured by his place, and it was exactly what we wanted. Downtown Eugene with a window over looking the park across the street, clean organized work space, and walking distance to almost everything. Ben was also a like-minded artist, who had moved to Eugene from Ohio a few years back, so we all really connected really well. (#humanconnection) It's beautiful to see how much knowledge, inspiration, and passion can be shared between people when they just drop their guard and truly get to know each other.



I started off simple by just writing some college papers- despite not being an actual student, and in that first week, I made more money off of typing words and helping people than I would have made at the factory. Blake started managing the papers for me while I looked into other freelance work like digital marketing and copy writing on Fiverr (paid freelance gigs anyone can sign up!) and money just kept coming in. In order to add more income and less work hours, we signed up for Post Mates and some of the friendly people of the city tip really well.

This new flow of income was obviously welcomed warmly, but what truly set passion to my heart was knowing that people were coming to me and trusting me to provide a service for them and I was helping them out at the same time. What we both wanted to do was help as many people as possible and not starve to death while doing it. I am far from a rich man, but there is gas in my car, food in the cabinet, clothes on my back, a comfy warm bed to come back to at the end of the day.

This past Sunday the weather was really nice so Blake, Ben, and I decided to hit a local vegan smoothie spot. It was in this beautifully decorated utopia, that I decided to put a name to my vision, #HumanConnection. Like I said I am far from rich, but this week my girlfriend and I are dropping the top on the old black Mustang and taking a 8 hour drive down to San Francisco to film this project I came up with. Don't worry, it's not going to be us stroking our egos on camera in a condescending way. In fact, we don't even want to be behind the camera, #HumanConnection is about capturing that raw human emotion in the moment and hopefully provoking emotion in whoever views it. Anyways, that is the goal and I hope you reading this can see the vision, follow along, and maybe even be inspired to do something yourself! That is about all the time I have right now, so for now your favorite not-so-starving writer is signing off, until next time friends.
