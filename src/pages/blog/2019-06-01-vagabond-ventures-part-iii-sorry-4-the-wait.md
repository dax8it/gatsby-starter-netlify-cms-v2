As I navigate through the twists and turns of early adulthood, I learn to treat life with the same respect and admiration one would have towards a beautiful, yet feral animal. I have seen everything from the insides of beautifully constructed five-star hotels around the world to the insides decaying jail cells with blood-stained floors. And so kiddies, the story of the vagabond artist continues and memories continue to be made. I know where I have been, I love where I'm at, and I can only sit back and enjoy the ride to where I am headed.

In the last installment of the series (also located on this site) I left off on the note that I was heading to San Francisco to film some content I had come up with. Well apparently, I had spoken too soon because I believe it was the very next morning that my girlfriend ran into my room panicking and crying saying that my car was outside being towed. When life closes one door, sometimes you just need to peek around the corner and see that a different one has opened. The metaphorical door being opened here was the opportunity to see a different perspective on how to properly handle what I needed to be doing. The self-percieved embarrassment I was going through caused me to really slow down and carefully execute some other plans I had going on, and I am still working towards some of the humanitarian goals I had spoken on two months ago. The Eugene Police Department's legally debatable acquisition of my car may have actually helped me in the long run.

In an attempt to keep this as organized as possible, I will start with our living situation. Our time at Ben's came to an end, and we were lucky to secure a last minute 6-month lease in the more suburban part of town. What we lost in location, was made up for in stability. Our roommates consist of our Brazilian landlord, an older woman from Georgia, a 37-year-old aspiring actor, and an 18-year-old girl who is pretty introverted when she is not stealing our Mac n Cheese boxes. (no hard feelings Bailey) In this house is where tears of happiness and frustration are shed, art is created and destroyed, money is earned and spent, but it is in this house where the foundations of the future are being laid out.

 Note to the fellow future writer, this shit is fucking difficult. A lot of what you do in the beginning stages of your career consists of boring technical writing and tremendously underpaid labor. The road to insanity is paved with good intentions. It is easy to become overwhelmed in the joyless world of copywriting, SEO writing, and product reviews. I was able to secure a niche in writing college papers and was able to make well over a thousand dollars with my craft, but my soul can only handle so many 10-page research papers. The double-edged sword of this lifestyle is that the writing that you do to put food on the table is not exactly the writing that you want to be remembered for. One kid actually paid me to write a poem, and it ended up being published in his school's literary magazine under his name. (talk about bittersweet)

 I recently got back into skateboarding after at least 5 years of not even owning a pair of skate shoes. The skateboarding is a little sentimental to me because prior to losing myself, I was that teenager with long hair into poetry, Jim Morrison, skateboarding, and reading. Everywhere I moved in Oregon I ended up down the street from a different skatepark. I finally caved and next thing I knew I was putting $40 in the hands of a 17-year-old boy from the internet in exchange for his sketchy board. Much like my writing, it is crucial to balance the enjoyment, self-discipline, and dedication needed to progress the way I really want to. I also had an interview I wanted to conduct with a federal inmate and share with you guys. Again, it seems that life had a different plan for me apparently because after publicly announcing my plans and working hard on creating meaningful questions, the star of the show seemed to vanish off the face of the earth. (or hopefully escaped..who knows?)

 To prevent this from turning into the ramblings of a mad man, I'll start wrapping this post up. My Mustang is currently sitting outside in the driveway waiting to be sold for this international move I have planned for September. I do not want to jinx the situation, so there will be more details about that shared at a later date. My lovely girlfriend has branched out into the world of Youtube and sometimes lets my ugly mug in the videos. I hold on to my mental stability for dear life while trying to balance creative writing with corporate writing. We continue to build our digital marketing company, travel, laugh, cry, and carve our own individual paths in this game called life. I am going to make a conscious effort to post more frequently here about anything and everything I can. As a child playing sports and having terrible hand-eye coordination, I sometimes thought that I "just wasn't good at a lot of things". Writing, weight training, and skateboarding all proved to me that you'd be surprised by what your true ability is if you just eat some shit and humiliate yourself every once in a while. Anyways, I'll drop the mic at that little jewel of wisdom right there and sign off for now. On a serious note guys, I appreciate those of you who take the time to read these and my dms are always open for topic suggestions or possible collaboration ideas. I do it for you just as much as I do it for myself.
