title: 10 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Weight Training

  The new year is here and the “new” you is coming in hot pursuit. The failed
  resolutions of the last three years were just practice for this year of
  unmatched success and self-improvement. 2017’s resolution of reading more?
  Boring, next. Last year’s goal of being more social? Who are you kidding? This
  year, you decided that what’s really holding you back is your lack of muscle
  mass and a totally unnecessary amount of strength. I’ve been in that
  predicament before and I made it out. I was weighing 150 pounds at 6 feet tall
  and couldn’t do a single pull-up. After a long time of putting in blood,
  sweat, tears, and the occasional wondering, “Why am I even doing this?”, I’m
  here to tell you ten things that I wish someone told me before I embarked on
  my iron journey.

1. **Nobody’s looking at you and nobody cares.**  Seriously, No. One. Cares. The human ego is such a powerful thing. Everyone is too busy being self-absorbed to really care about whatever you’re doing.

2. **The supplement industry is a SCAM.**  You’ll notice a lot of “nutrition” companies trying to get a buck out of the New Year’s resolutioners as well. Everything from that eight-dollar smoothie from the gym counter (delicious, but unnecessary) to that sixty-dollar tub of all kinds of proteins, is totally useless. Your favorite fitness Instagrammer did not get that perfectly sculpted abdominal structure from a waist trainer, I don’t care how many promo codes they try and give you. The best supplement is CLEAN FOOD and lots of it.

3. **Get creative and keep it fun.** Following a structured program and diet is obviously very beneficial to your fitness goals. However, the monotony of doing the same exercise and reps over and over again could make working out seem like a chore instead of a hobby. Sometimes you have to come up with little challenges in your head to spice it up and keep your muscles shocked.

4. **Do your own research.** There is so much false information being spread around by steroid-using meatheads, teenage boys in uneven homemade cut-offs, and obese uncles who “used to bench 315 before my rotator cuff gave out, I swear” that you really can’t trust anything you hear. You need to take the time and read articles from unbiased informational sites if you really want to get the most out of your training.

5. **The gains will slow down.** Much like star athletes in high school, no one prepares you for the depression that ensues after the glory days are over. For the first six months, you pretty much gain muscle just from standing next to the weights. After that, get ready to grind slow and meticulous just to fix the smallest detail on your physique.

6. **Training legs is a necessary evil.** No one prepares you for excruciating post-leg-day soreness. For two to three days, everything from walking up stairs to sitting on the toilet, will hurt and it’ll hurt a lot. Get in the habit of training legs early on so your body stays proportional.

7. Working out is a commitment and a serious one. In order to really gain strength and pack on some mass, it’s going to require a lot of TIME and EFFORT. You’re going to have to go on that miserable rainy day, that day where you’re tired from being yelled at at work all day, that early morning window before your whole day is busy.

8. **People may doubt you or poke fun at you.** Whether you are paper thin or morbidly obese, people may not take you seriously at first. Fuck them, this is about you. At the end of the day, this isn’t rocket science. With a lot of time combined with the simple knowledge of what to eat and how to train, you are going to change your body for the better and everyone who had their opinion is still on the sidelines where you left them.

9. **The best pre-workout is a scoop of some heart, mixed with a nice cup of “how badly do you want this?”** When I first started training in 2017, I fell right into the supplement trap. I immediately started taking pre-workout before every gym session. This is a terrible habit to get into and I strongly recommend against it. For one, your tolerance to this stuff will skyrocket and it’ll barely work. If you take it too late in the day, you can forget about a full night’s sleep (which is crucial in muscle building). Some pre-workouts I tried even had a crash affect that made me feel anxious and nauseated after the initial affect wore off.

10. **You will become addicted after you get that first taste of progress.** Congratulations! Some of those T-shirts laying around your closet are starting to get a little snug around the arms and shoulders. That number on the scale is starting to go up (or down). You might have even received your first unsolicited compliment. Well, my friend, welcome to the pursuit of vanity and remember to enjoy yourself while you push your body to its physical limit and break down all psychological barriers you had previously set for yourself.
