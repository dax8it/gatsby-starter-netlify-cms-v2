Gather round boys and girls, it's story time. The misguided adventures of your favorite starving writer continue. The other experiences that I have been writing about on here are all from the past but today I'm writing this from a Barnes and Nobles about 2,000 miles away from the place I called home up until three weeks ago. Following the typical pattern that my life takes, I ended up in a situation that I just feel obligated to share with someone just so I can confirm that all of this is real and I am not dreaming it all up. I embarked on this journey with my girlfriend totally unprepared because the honest truth of the matter is, I feel that you can never truly be prepared for anything and I was not going to let the time go by talking about something that "I could have done" sometimes you just have to grab the bull by the horns and just fucking follow your heart. You are only young one time so you might as well take risks and take a little something from each of these experiences with you. 

We both put a pause on all unnecessary spending, worked miserable dead end jobs, and smiled back at the negative comments from friends and family. We had booked the flight a little prematurely out of excitement. The girl who we were originally going to live with had ended up trying to scam us and threatened us not to come to Oregon because "she knew people". After laughing and hanging up on the phone, we were back in the grind of the craigslist shuffle. (She actually reached out about two days later, asking if we were still interested in the room...I never replied.) This is where Ryan aka "Rye Bread" comes into the picture and tries to take a big steaming shit on our dreams and aspirations.

While searching for apartments on Craigslist, we ended up exchanging a few messages with this guy and ended up making a phone call that would change my life (at least for right now). My girlfriend and I had really dedicated a lot of time to spirituality and self exploration. We really wanted to tread further down this path and that is part of the reason we ended up heading to Oregon as well as education and diving into adulthood. We finally got on the phone with Rye and he had talked a big talk about supporting what we were doing, wanting to help, and spreading love and kindness. I had gotten on the phone with him and we started to discuss pricing because he had wanted first and last month's rent as a deposit. He said that out of the kindness of his heart he would make an exception for us and that he would pick us up from the airport. He had also expressed to my girlfriend Blake that he would like to only go through her because I was a little too "New York" for him (whatever that means). 

So as time went on and we were getting ready to tackle this new adventure head on, he would text us things about spirituality and things like that. At first glance they appeared nice..but they started being a little incoherent and we just wrote it off as maybe he is just a little weird but he means well. My car is eventually picked up for transport and me and my girlfriend are dropped off at the airport...also for transport. After taking a million pictures at every stage of the air travel, we finally landed at the Eugene airport and were waiting on our new hippie friend to come pick us up and take us to our new home for our new life.
